# 🔐 Text Encryption using AES, DES, and RSA

This project is a **Python-based text encryption and decryption tool** that demonstrates the use of three widely used cryptographic algorithms:  
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**  
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**  
- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**  

It allows users to input text, and see how it is securely encrypted and decrypted using each algorithm, helping to understand the differences between **symmetric** and **asymmetric** encryption.
